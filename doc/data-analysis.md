### Key Business Flow

1. **Customer Company** creates an **RFQ** with multiple **Part Numbers**
2. **Supplier Companies** submit **Quotations** for individual parts
3. **Global Quotations** aggregate selected quotes into comprehensive proposals
4. **Junction table** maintains traceability between global quotes and individual part quotes

### Data Patterns Observed

#### Company Distribution
- Mix of large enterprises (Caterpillar, Jabil, IMMI) and specialized manufacturers
- International scope with companies from various countries
- HubSpot integration for CRM pipeline management

#### RFQ Characteristics
- Multi-part projects (assemblies, sub-components)
- Volume-based manufacturing (500 - 500,000+ annual units)
- Technical complexity requiring 3D models and detailed drawings
- Status-driven workflow management

#### Quotation Patterns
- Version control for iterative negotiations
- Detailed cost breakdown including:
  - Material costs
  - Manufacturing processes (CNC, HPDC, injection molding)
  - Tooling considerations
  - Lead times and MOQ requirements

#### Global Quotation Structure
- Customer-centric aggregation of multiple part quotes
- Draft status management for proposal development
- RFQ linkage maintaining project context

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Foreign Key Relationships
- Companies serve dual roles (customers and suppliers)
- RFQs maintain supplier assignment for targeted quoting
- Part Numbers link to both originating company and RFQ
- Quotations reference both part and supplier for clear attribution
- Global Quotations aggregate through junction table

### Data Integrity
